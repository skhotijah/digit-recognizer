This work tries to classifying MNIST Dataset.
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike[1].

This work using the Support Vector Machine Classifier. The predictor variable uses all pixels as features and uses a label as a target. You can find the original code that I have build in this link https://www.kaggle.com/khotijahs1/digit-recognizer-support-vector-machine
